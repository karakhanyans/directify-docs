Tags provide an additional layer of organization for your directory listings, helping users discover related content and improving the overall navigation experience. Unlike categories, tags are more flexible and can be applied across multiple listings regardless of their primary category.

## Creating and Managing Tags

### Basic Tag Information

- **Title** (Required) - The tag name that appears on your listings (without the # symbol - this is automatically added)
- **Slug** - Automatically generated URL-friendly version of your tag title
- **Color** - Custom background color for your tag badges
- **Text Color** - Custom text color for optimal readability
- **Icon** - Optional visual icon to accompany your tag

### Visual Customization

Tags in Directify are highly customizable to match your directory's design:

#### Color Scheme
- **Background Color** - Set a unique color for each tag to create visual distinction
- **Text Color** - Ensure proper contrast and readability
- **Icon Support** - Upload custom icons to make tags more visually appealing

#### Display Options
- **Show Title** - Control whether the tag text is visible (enabled by default)
- **Show Icon** - Toggle icon visibility on listings pages
- **Active Status** - Enable or disable tags without deleting them

## Tag Implementation

### On Listing Pages
Tags appear on individual listing pages to help users:
- Identify related topics and themes
- Navigate to similar listings
- Understand listing characteristics at a glance

### On Listing Cards
In the listings grid/list view, tags provide:
- Quick visual identification
- Filtering and discovery capabilities
- Enhanced categorization beyond primary categories

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming** - Use clear, descriptive tag names that users will easily understand
2. **Color Strategy** - Develop a color scheme that aligns with your directory's branding
3. **Icon Usage** - Use icons sparingly for the most important tags to avoid visual clutter
4. **Tag Hierarchy** - Consider creating related tag groups for better organization
5. **Regular Review** - Periodically review and consolidate similar or redundant tags

<Note>
  Tags are automatically prefixed with # when displayed to users, so you don't need to include the hash symbol when creating tag titles.
</Note>

## Advanced Features

### Tag Filtering
Users can filter listings by tags, making it easier to find specific types of content within your directory.

### Search Integration
Tags are indexed for search functionality, helping users discover relevant listings through tag-based queries.

### Analytics
Track which tags are most popular to understand user interests and optimize your tagging strategy.
