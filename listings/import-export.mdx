Directify provides powerful import and export capabilities to help you manage your listings in bulk. You can easily import listings from a CSV file and export your existing listings to CSV format.

## Importing Listings

To import listings into your directory:

1. Download the example CSV file to see the correct format
2. Prepare your CSV file with the following columns:

### Required Fields
- **name** - The listing name (required, max 255 characters)

### Optional Fields
- **description** - A brief description of the listing
- **content** - Detailed content/body text for the listing
- **url** - Website URL (max 255 characters) 
- **phone_number** - Contact phone number (max 255 characters)
- **email** - Contact email address (max 255 characters)
- **address** - Physical address (max 255 characters)
- **tags** - Comma separated list of tags (max 255 characters)
- **is_no_follow** - SEO nofollow setting (1/0, true/false, yes/no, y/n)
- **is_featured** - Featured listing status (1/0, true/false, yes/no, y/n)
- **is_active** - Published status (1/0, true/false, yes/no, y/n)
- **logo_url** - URL to listing logo image (max 255 characters)
- **image_url** - URL to listing cover image (max 255 characters)

<Note>
  **Important:** The boolean fields (is_no_follow, is_featured, is_active) should be set to 1 (true) or 0 (false) or y (yes) or n (no).
</Note>

### Import Settings

When importing, you can configure:

1. **Categories** - Assign imported listings to specific categories
2. **Update Existing** - Choose whether to update existing records
3. **Default Publishing** - Set whether imported listings should be published by default (this will override the is_active field in the CSV file)

  Make sure your CSV file uses UTF-8 encoding for proper handling of special characters.

## Exporting Listings

You can export all your listings to CSV format for backup or bulk editing purposes. The exported file will contain all the fields listed above.

  Large directories may take a few moments to export. The system will notify you once your export is ready for download.
