Any payment processor that supports payment links will work (PayPal, RazorPay, Square, Stripe Payment Links, etc.). Just create your payment links and configure plans manually.

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Paid Submissions**
2. Enable **Paid Submissions**
3. Select **Custom (PayPal, RazorPay or other)**

## Create Plans

For each plan, configure:

- **Name** - Plan display name
- **Price** - Amount and currency symbol
- **Payment Link** - URL to your payment processor (e.g., `https://paypal.me/yourbusiness/29`)
- **Button Text** - CTA text (e.g., "Buy Now")
- **Is Subscription** - Toggle for recurring payments
- **Features** - List of included/excluded features

## Payment Flow

1. User submits listing and selects a plan
2. User is redirected to your payment link
3. User completes payment externally
4. You manually verify payment and approve the listing

<Note>
  Since payment links don't support webhooks, you'll need to manually check your payment processor and approve listings after payment confirmation.
