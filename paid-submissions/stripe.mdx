This guide will walk you through integrating Stripe with your directory to accept paid submissions. By following these steps, you can enable paid submissions, set up Stripe as the payment provider, and configure subscription and one-time payment plans.

## 1. Enable Paid Submissions

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section of your directory.
2. Locate the **Paid Submissions** option.
3. Enable **Paid Submissions** and select **Stripe** as the payment provider.

## 2. Configure Stripe API Keys

To integrate Stripe, you need to obtain your API keys from the Stripe dashboard.

1. Log in to your **Stripe Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section (search for "API Keys" in the dashboard search bar).
3. Copy the following keys:
   - **Publishable Key**
   - **Secret Key**
4. Paste these keys into the corresponding fields in your directory settings.

## 3. Configure Webhooks

Webhooks are required for Stripe to communicate payment events with your directory.

1. In your directory settings, locate the **Webhook URL**.
2. Go to the **Webhooks** section in your Stripe dashboard.
3. Click **Create Destination** and paste the **Webhook URL** provided by your directory.
4. Select **Events** to listen to. For simplicity, select **All Events**.
5. Click **Add Endpoint**.
6. Once the endpoint is created, Stripe will generate a **Signing Secret**.
7. Copy the **Signing Secret** and paste it into the corresponding field in your directory settings.
8. Click **Verify Credentials** to ensure proper connection.

## 4. Create Payment Plans in Stripe

1. Navigate to **Products** in your Stripe dashboard.
2. Create a **New Product** for each submission plan.
   - You can create **Subscription Plans** (e.g., Monthly, Yearly).
   - You can also create **One-Time Payment Plans**.
3. Save your products.

## 5. Sync Payment Plans with Your Directory

Once your Stripe integration is set up, your directory will automatically fetch available plans.

1. Verify that your plans are listed in the directory settings.
2. You can:
   - Modify plan **descriptions**.
   - Change **button text**.
   - Add **features** to display.
   - Hide plans that you donâ€™t want users to see.
3. Click **Save** to finalize the setup.

## 6. User Experience for Paid Submissions

1. A user submits their content to the directory.
2. They are directed to the **submission dashboard**.
3. They click **Pay and Submit for Review**.
4. Available **plans** (subscription or one-time payments) are displayed.
5. The user selects a plan and completes payment via Stripe.
6. Upon successful payment, their submission is processed for review.

## Conclusion

Your directory is now integrated with Stripe, enabling seamless paid submissions. Users can choose between subscriptions and one-time payments, ensuring flexibility and convenience.
