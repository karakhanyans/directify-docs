You can customize various routes in your directory to match your branding and preferences. This includes routes for listings, categories, blog posts, custom pages, and forms.

## Listings Routes

Configure how your listing URLs are structured:

- **Listing Route**: Set the prefix for listing pages (default: `listings`)
  - Example: If set to `tools`, listings will be at `https://yourdomain.com/tools/{listing-slug}`

- **Show Listings Through Category**: When enabled, listings appear under their category URLs
  - Default: `https://yourdomain.com/listings/{listing-slug}`
  - With categories: `https://yourdomain.com/{category-slug}/{listing-slug}`
   
  <Note>
    If a listing belongs to multiple categories, it will be accessible through all of them.
