The listings route allows you to customize the URL path for your individual listing pages. By default, listings are accessed at `/listings/[listing-slug]`, but you can customize this prefix to match your directory's structure.

## Customizing the Listings Route

To change your listings route:

1. Go to your edit directory page
2. Navigate to the "Listing Route" section
3. Enter your desired route prefix (e.g., "products", "resources", etc.)
4. Click "Save"

For example, if you set the listings route to "products":
- Default URL: `yourdomain.com/listings/awesome-product`
- New URL: `yourdomain.com/products/awesome-product`

<Note>
    Changing the listings route will automatically redirect all existing listing URLs to the new path, so you won't lose any traffic or links.
</Note>

## Best Practices

When choosing a listings route:
- Use descriptive terms that reflect your content (e.g., "tools", "businesses", "resources")
- Keep it short and memorable
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens only
- Avoid special characters or spaces

<Warning>
    The listings route must be unique and cannot conflict with other routes in your directory (like category pages or custom pages).
</Warning>
