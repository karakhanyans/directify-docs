After creating your directory with a default subdomain, you can connect your own custom domain to make your directory more professional and branded.

## Setting up your custom domain

Connecting your custom domain involves three main steps:

1. Add your domain in Directify settings
2. Configure DNS records at your domain provider
3. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 24-48 hours)

### Step 1: Add Your Domain

In your directories list, click on "Click to set custom domain" button.

1. Navigate to the "Custom Domain" section
2. Enter your domain name (e.g., `directory.com`)
3. Click "Next" to the DNS records section

You can add either:
- A root domain (e.g., `directory.com`)
- A subdomain (e.g., `tools.directory.com`)

<Note>
    Make sure you own the domain before adding it. You'll need access to manage its DNS records.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure DNS Records

After adding your domain, you'll need to configure DNS records at your domain provider (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains).

For root domains, add this A record:
- Type: **A**
- Hostname: `@` or your domain (e.g. `directory.com`) 
- Value: `159.223.235.17`

For subdomains, add this CNAME record:
- Type: **CNAME**
- Hostname: your subdomain (e.g. `tools.directory.com`)
- Target: `your-directory.directify.app`
- TTL: 43200 (or provider default)

<Note>
    If you're using a subdomain, you'll need to add a CNAME record instead of an A record.
</Note>

### Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation

After adding the records, it may take up to 24-48 hours for the changes to propagate.

Once DNS records are updated, your custom domain will be active and your directory will be accessible at `https://your-domain.com`.

<Note>
    If the domain is not working, please check your DNS records and make sure they are correct. After verifying the records, you do this steps again to trigger verification process.
</Note>

### Verified

After the domain is verified, you will see a green checkmark in the Directify settings.
