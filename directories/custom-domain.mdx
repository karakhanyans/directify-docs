Custom domains allow you to use your own domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) instead of the default Directify subdomain. Your directory will be served over HTTPS with an automatically managed SSL certificate.

## Step 1: Add Your Domain

1. Go to your **Directory Settings**
2. Click **Custom Domain** in the sidebar
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or `directory.yourdomain.com`)
4. Click **Next**

## Step 2: Configure DNS Records

After entering your domain, you'll see the DNS records you need to add. Go to your domain registrar or DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains) and add the following records.

### CNAME Record (Required)

Point your domain to Directify's servers:

| Type | Name | Target |
|------|------|--------|
| CNAME | `@` or `yourdomain.com` | `custom.directify.app` |

<Info>
  **For root domains:** Some DNS providers don't support CNAME records on the root domain (`@`). In this case, look for "CNAME flattening", "ANAME", or "ALIAS" record options. Cloudflare handles this automatically. See [Root Domain Limitations](#root-domain-apex-cname-limitations) for workarounds.
</Info>

### TXT Record for Domain Ownership (Required)

Add this TXT record for ownership verification:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| TXT | `_cf-custom-hostname.yourdomain.com` | *(Copy the value shown in the setup wizard)* |

The exact name and value will be displayed in the Custom Domain setup page after you enter your domain.

<Warning>
  Copy the exact values shown in your setup wizard. Each domain gets unique verification values.
</Warning>

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Step 3: Wait for Verification

After adding all DNS records, click **Submit** to start the verification process.

DNS propagation typically takes:
- **1-5 minutes** - Cloudflare, AWS Route 53
- **1-4 hours** - Google Domains, Namecheap
- **12-48 hours** - Some registrars (rare)

You'll receive an email notification when your domain is verified and active.

</Frame>

## Step 4: SSL Certificate

Once DNS is verified, Directify automatically provisions a free SSL certificate. No action required - HTTPS is enabled automatically.

Your directory will be accessible at `https://yourdomain.com` within minutes of DNS verification.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DNS not propagating?">
    - **Verify DNS records are correct** - Double-check all record types, names, and values
    - **Clear local DNS cache** - Run `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows) or `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` (Mac)
    - **Check propagation status** - Use [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) to verify your records are visible globally
    - **Wait longer** - Some registrars take up to 48 hours to propagate changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL certificate not working?">
    - **Wait up to 1 hour** after DNS verification for SSL to fully activate
    - **Check TXT records** - Missing or incorrect TXT records prevent SSL certificate issuance
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Domain shows 'Pending' for too long?">
    - Verify all required DNS records are added (CNAME + TXT records)
    - Check for typos in record values
    - Ensure you're editing DNS for the correct domain
    - Contact support on [Discord](https://discord.gg/B9hTD4kAJY) if issues persist after 24 hours
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Domain already in use' error?">
    This domain is already connected to another Directify directory. If you own this domain and need to transfer it, contact support.
  </Accordion>

## Removing a Custom Domain

1. Go to **Directory Settings** → **Custom Domain**
2. Click **Remove Domain**
3. Confirm the removal

Your directory will revert to using the default Directify subdomain. You can optionally remove the DNS records from your domain registrar.

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Setting up www redirect

To redirect `www.yourdomain.com` to `yourdomain.com`:

1. Add a CNAME record:
   - Name: `www`
   - Target: `yourdomain.com`

2. Configure a redirect in your DNS provider (if supported) or use a redirect service

### Multiple domains

Currently, each directory supports one custom domain. If you need multiple domains pointing to the same directory, set up redirects at the DNS level to your primary custom domain.

---

## Root Domain (Apex) CNAME Limitations

Some DNS providers don't support CNAME records on root/apex domains (e.g., `yourdomain.com` without any subdomain). This is a technical limitation of the DNS specification, not a Directify limitation.

### How to check if your provider supports it

Try adding a CNAME record with `@` as the name. If your provider shows an error like "CNAME not allowed on root domain" or "Cannot add CNAME to apex", you'll need to use one of the workarounds below.

### Providers that support root domain CNAME

These providers support CNAME flattening, ANAME, or ALIAS records on root domains:

- **Cloudflare** (free) - Automatic CNAME flattening
- **AWS Route 53** - ALIAS records
- **DNSimple** - ALIAS records
- **DNS Made Easy** - ANAME records
- **NS1** - ALIAS records
- **Netlify DNS** - Automatic handling
- **Vercel DNS** - Automatic handling

### Providers that don't support root domain CNAME

- GoDaddy (basic DNS)
- Namecheap (basic DNS)
- Some traditional registrar DNS services

### Workarounds

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Use a subdomain (Easiest)">
    Instead of `yourdomain.com`, use a www subdomain:
    - `www.yourdomain.com`

    Then set up a redirect from your root domain to the subdomain using your registrar's forwarding feature.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 2: Use Cloudflare DNS (Recommended)">
    Cloudflare offers free DNS hosting with automatic CNAME flattening:

    1. Create a free account at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)
    2. Add your domain to Cloudflare
    3. Update your domain's nameservers to Cloudflare's (provided during setup)
    4. Add your DNS records in Cloudflare's dashboard

    <Note>
      You don't need to transfer your domain - just point the nameservers to Cloudflare. Your domain registration stays with your current registrar.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 3: Check for ALIAS/ANAME support">
    Some providers offer ALIAS or ANAME records as alternatives to CNAME for root domains. Check your DNS provider's documentation for:
    - "ALIAS record"
    - "ANAME record"
    - "Flattened CNAME"
    - "Virtual CNAME"

    If available, use the same target (`custom.directify.app`) with an ALIAS/ANAME record type.
