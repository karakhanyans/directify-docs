In this section you will learn how to customize your directory with Directify, add your logo, change the theme, and more.

## Logo

Logo is the first thing that visitors see when they visit your directory. It helps them recognize your brand right away and establishes your directory's visual identity. A well-designed logo builds trust and professionalism.

You can upload your logo in several formats:
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG (best for scalability)

After uploading your logo, you have several editing options:
- Crop to perfect dimensions
- Resize while maintaining aspect ratio
- Adjust brightness and contrast
- Add padding if needed
- Set custom alt text for accessibility

We recommend using a logo that:
- Is simple and recognizable
- Has good contrast with the background
- Remains clear when scaled down
- Includes your brand name (optional)

## Favicon
A favicon is the small icon that appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and mobile home screens when users save your directory as a shortcut. It's a crucial branding element that helps visitors quickly identify your site among their open tabs.

You can upload your favicon in these formats:
- ICO (traditional favicon format)
- PNG (recommended for modern browsers)
- SVG (scalable vector format)

Best practices for favicons:
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes (16x16 pixels)
- Use your logo or a simplified version of it
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Test how it looks in both light and dark browser themes

After uploading, you can:
- Crop and resize the image
- Adjust brightness and contrast
- Add padding if needed
- Preview how it looks in different contexts

## Themes

Theme is the color scheme of your directory. You can choose from 30+ themes available, ranging from light and minimal to dark and vibrant options.

Each theme includes carefully selected:
- Primary and secondary colors
- Background and foreground colors  
- Accent colors for buttons and interactive elements
- Text colors optimized for readability
- Hover and active states

Themes automatically handle both light and dark mode variations, ensuring your directory looks great regardless of user preference.

Directify uses DaisyUI for themes, which provides:
- Consistent styling across all components
- Accessibility-friendly color combinations
- Modern, polished aesthetics
- Seamless dark/light mode transitions

You can preview and switch themes instantly in the settings panel. Changes apply immediately across your entire directory.

You can learn more about DaisyUI themes and color systems in their [documentation](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).
