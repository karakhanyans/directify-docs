Team members help you manage your directory by giving them different levels of access. You can add team members with specific roles to collaborate effectively while maintaining security.

## Adding Team Members

To add a team member:

1. Go to your directory settings
2. Navigate to the "Team" section
3. Click "Add Team Member"
4. Enter their details:
   - Email address
   - Name
   - Role
5. Click "Save"

## Team Member Roles

Directify offers three role levels for team members:

    Full access to manage everything except deleting the directory
  </Card>
  <Card title="Editor" icon="user-pen">
    Can manage listings and categories
  </Card>
  <Card title="Viewer" icon="user">
    Read-only access to view entries
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Role Permissions

#### Manager
