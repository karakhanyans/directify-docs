Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your Directify account. When an event occurs, we'll send an HTTP POST request to the URL you specify.

## Security

Each webhook request includes a signature in the `X-Directify-Signature` header. You should verify this signature to ensure the request came from Directify.

### Verifying Signatures

Here's how to verify the signature:

```php
// PHP example
$payload = file_get_contents('php://input');
$signature = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_DIRECTIFY_SIGNATURE'];
$secret = 'your_webhook_secret';

$calculatedSignature = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (hash_equals($calculatedSignature, $signature)) {
    // Signature is valid
} else {
    // Signature is invalid
}
```

## Request Format

All webhook requests are sent as HTTP POST requests with a JSON payload. The following headers are included:

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `X-Directify-Signature`: HMAC SHA-256 signature
- `X-Directify-Event`: The name of the event (e.g., `project.created`)

## Payload Format

The payload includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `event` | The name of the event |
| `timestamp` | The Unix timestamp when the event occurred |
| `id` | The ID of the affected resource |
| `model` | The type of resource (e.g., Project) |
| `data` | The full resource data |
| `changes` | For update events, the fields that were changed (before and after) |

<Note>
    For listings, the `model` will be `Project`, and the events are also prefixed with `project` as that's how we handle them internally.
</Note>

## Available Events

The following events are available:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `project.created` | Listing Created |
| `project.updated` | Listing Updated |
| `project.deleted` | Listing Deleted |
| `lead.created` | Lead Created |
| `lead.updated` | Lead Updated |
| `lead.deleted` | Lead Deleted |
| `category.created` | Category Created |
| `category.updated` | Category Updated |
| `category.deleted` | Category Deleted |
| `ad.created` | Ad Created |
| `ad.updated` | Ad Updated |
| `ad.deleted` | Ad Deleted |
| `article.created` | Article Created |
| `article.updated` | Article Updated |
| `article.deleted` | Article Deleted |
| `tag.created` | Tag Created |
| `tag.updated` | Tag Updated |
| `tag.deleted` | Tag Deleted |

## Best Practices

- Always verify the signature of incoming webhook requests
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate webhook deliveries
- Respond quickly to webhook requests (within 5 seconds)
- Implement proper error handling for webhook processing
