Automatically generate high-quality website screenshots for your listings with [ScreenshotOne](https://screenshotone.com/?ref=directify). This integration gives you fast, reliable screenshots without needing to upload images manually, helping your directory look polished and consistent.

## Key Features

- **Auto-generate screenshots** for websites when adding new listings
- **Manual capture** with a single click while editing any listing
- **Bulk import automation** — automatically capture screenshots during CSV imports
- **Bulk Screenshots for Selected Listings** — select multiple listings in your directory and generate screenshots for all of them at once
- **Optimized storage** — all screenshots are saved and compressed in your media library

## Setup

To enable ScreenshotOne integration:

1. Create a [ScreenshotOne account](https://screenshotone.com/?ref=directify)
2. Grab your API key and secret from the ScreenshotOne dashboard
3. Go to **Settings → Integrations** inside Directify
4. Enter your API credentials and save the integration

## How It Works

### Manual Screenshots

Click the camera icon next to the cover image field when creating or editing a listing. This will instantly capture a screenshot of the website URL.

### Bulk Screenshots (Selected Listings)

In the listings table, select multiple items and choose the **"Generate Screenshot"** bulk action. This allows you to generate screenshots for multiple listings at once, saving time when managing large directories.

### Automatic Import

When importing via CSV, enable the auto-screenshot option and Directify will capture everything automatically. This ensures every imported listing has a professional preview without manual intervention.

<Note>
Screenshots are only generated for listings with valid URLs.
