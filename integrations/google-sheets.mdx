Integrating Google Sheets with Directify has been a highly requested feature, and it is now available! 
This integration allows users to create directories from Google Sheets, back up their data, and seamlessly sync listings between Directify and Google Sheets. 

Here's a detailed guide on how to set it up and use it effectively.

## **Connecting Google Sheets Integration**

You can connect Google Sheets to Directify in two ways:
1. **Through Listings:** Navigate to your listings and connect directly.
2. **Through Settings:** Go to *Settings > Integrations* and connect your Google Sheets API.

For this guide, we'll use the Listings method.

### **Step 1: Connecting Google Sheets**
Once you initiate the integration, a Google authentication screen will appear, prompting you to grant access to Google Sheets. After granting access, Directify will connect to your Google account, enabling you to create directories from Google Sheets effortlessly.

### **Step 2: Creating a Template**
After connecting, you must create a template. This ensures that all necessary fields, including listing fields, categories, tags, and custom fields, are included in your Google Sheet.

> You can also manually connect your Google Sheets URL, but it will not automatically include the required fields. If you only need specific details like *name* and *URL*, you can use this option. However, using the *Create Template* function is recommended for a complete data set.

### **Step 3: Populating Your Google Sheet**
Once the template is created, you can:
- Manually populate the fields and add listings in Google Sheets.
- Push existing listings from Directify to Google Sheets using the "Push to Google Sheets" button.
- Pull listings from Google Sheets to Directify using the "Pull from Google Sheets" button.

## **Two-Way Synchronization**

Two-way synchronization is now **automatically enabled** for all Google Sheets integrations. This means:
- Changes made in Directify can be pushed to Google Sheets.
- Changes made in Google Sheets can be pulled into Directify.
- Data stays in sync between both platforms.

### **Manual Sync Options**

You can manually sync your data at any time using two options:

- **Push to Google Sheets:** Uploads the latest data from Directify to Google Sheets.
- **Pull from Google Sheets:** Fetches the latest data from Google Sheets into Directify.

<Note>
**Sync Limitation:** You can only sync every 12 hours. This includes the automated daily sync at midnight UTC. If you try to sync before 12 hours have passed, the buttons will be disabled.
</Note>

### **Image Handling Options**

When syncing listings, you have two mutually exclusive options for handling images:

1. **Auto-Screenshot Listings:** Automatically captures screenshots from listing URLs when syncing. This requires the ScreenshotOne integration to be enabled.

2. **Re-Upload Images from URLs to Internal Storage:** Downloads images from `logo_url` and `image_url` columns in your Google Sheet and stores them in your internal media library. Only downloads if no existing image is uploaded.

<Note>
These options are mutually exclusive - enabling one will automatically turn off the other. Choose the option that best fits your workflow.
</Note>

### **Updating Listings**

To update a listing:
1. Edit the relevant field in Google Sheets (e.g., change "Larafast" to "Larafast Updated Name").
2. Click **Pull from Google Sheets** in Directify to fetch the updates.
3. The changes will be reflected in your Directify directory.

Similarly, updates made in Directify can be pushed back to Google Sheets using the **Push to Google Sheets** button.

**Pro Tip:** If you leave the **slug** column blank in Google Sheets, Directify will automatically generate it after syncing. The auto-generated slug will then be synced back to your Google Sheet for future matching.

## **Automated Daily Sync**
Directify automatically runs a sync every midnight (UTC) to ensure all changes in Google Sheets are reflected in your directory. This automated sync counts toward the 12-hour sync limitation.

If you need updates between the automated syncs, you can manually pull or push data at any time, as long as 12 hours have passed since the last sync.

## **Final Thoughts**
This Google Sheets integration is a simple yet powerful tool for managing and backing up your Directify listings. Whether you need a real-time sync, want to create a directory from Google Sheets, or even build a website from Google Sheets, this feature enhances efficiency and ensures your data is always up-to-date.

Cheers, and happy listing!
