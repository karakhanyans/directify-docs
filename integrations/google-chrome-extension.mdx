# Using the Chrome Extension

Our Chrome Extension allows you to save websites to your Directify directory with just one click. Here's how to set it up and use it effectively.

## 1. Generate Your API Key

Before using the extension, you need to create an API key:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ API** in your dashboard
2. Click the key icon to generate a new API key
3. Copy your API key immediately (it will only be shown once)
4. You can manage all your API keys from this screen

<Note>
  Make sure to save your API key in a secure location as it will only be displayed once.
</Note>

## 2. Connect the Extension

After generating your API key:

1. Install the Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cfmljcoemdlhghelinplaheifiipljpn)
2. Paste your API key into the input field
3. Your directories will automatically load inside the extension


## 3. Save Websites to Your Directory

When browsing the web:

1. Click on the Extension Icon in Chrome
2. Select the Directory you want to save the website to
3. Optionally choose a Category (or leave empty)
4. Click **Save**

That's it! The website will be added to your selected directory.

## 4. Bulk Saving Made Easy

To speed up adding multiple listings:

- The extension remembers your last selected directory and category
- No need to reselect for each new website
- You can change selections at any time before saving

## 5. Data Collection

The extension automatically fetches:

- Title
- Description
- Icon (favicon)
- Other available metadata from the URL

<Warning>
  If a URL is not publicly accessible (behind login walls, etc.), data collection might fail for that specific page.
</Warning>
