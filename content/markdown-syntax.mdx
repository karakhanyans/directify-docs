## FAQ Components

Create structured FAQ sections with automatic schema markup for SEO benefits:

### Basic FAQ Syntax
```markdown
::: faq
### What's the best way to use schema markup?
Schema markup is a game-changer for SEO. It helps search engines understand your content better and can lead to rich snippets in search results. The key is to use structured data that matches your content type.
:::

::: faq
### How do I optimize for featured snippets?
Focus on answering specific questions clearly and concisely. Use header tags (H2, H3) for questions and provide direct, comprehensive answers. Structure your content in lists, tables, or step-by-step formats when appropriate.
:::
```

<Note>
  CTA components use your directory's configured call-to-action content and styling. Customize the CTA design in your directory settings.

## Technical Implementation

### Where Components Work
Enhanced markdown syntax is available in:
- **Listing Content** - Rich descriptions with multimedia
- **Article Content** - Blog posts with embedded media
- **Category Descriptions** - Detailed category explanations  
- **Custom Pages** - Landing pages and informational content
- **Directory Descriptions** - About pages and site descriptions
- **Ad Content** - Rich advertising content

### Processing Order
1. **Standard Markdown** - Converted to HTML first
2. **@iframe Components** - Processed and embedded
3. **FAQ Components** - Structured with schema markup
4. **CTA Components** - Rendered with directory styling
5. **Cleanup** - Remaining syntax markers removed

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading** - Iframes load efficiently
- **Schema Caching** - FAQ schemas cached for performance
- **Mobile Optimization** - All components responsive
- **SEO Benefits** - Enhanced search engine visibility

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Iframe Not Loading
- **Check URL**: Ensure you're using embed URLs, not direct links
- **HTTPS Required**: Some platforms require secure connections
- **Platform Restrictions**: Some sites block iframe embedding

### FAQ Not Displaying
- **Header Format**: Ensure questions use `###` (H3) headers
- **Content Structure**: Place content directly after question headers
- **Proper Syntax**: Check opening and closing `:::` markers

### Syntax Not Processing
- **Exact Format**: Use exact `::: component :::` syntax
- **No Extra Spaces**: Avoid extra spaces in component declarations
- **Case Sensitive**: Component names are case-sensitive

## Migration from Standard Markdown

If you have existing markdown content:

1. **Backup Content** - Save original markdown files
2. **Gradual Enhancement** - Add components incrementally
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Preview content before publishing
4. **Update Links** - Ensure all embedded content works
5. **Monitor Performance** - Check loading speeds after updates

<Tip>
  Start with one component type (like @iframe) and gradually incorporate others as you become comfortable with the enhanced syntax.
