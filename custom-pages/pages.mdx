Custom pages allow you to create additional content pages for your directory website, such as "About Us", "Contact", or any informational pages. These pages can be placed in either the header or sidebar navigation.

## Creating a Custom Page

To create a custom page:

1. Enter a title for your page
2. Choose the placement (Header or Sidebar)
3. Select your content type:
   - **Markdown** - Write content using markdown formatting
   - **Page Builder** - Use a visual drag-and-drop builder

### Page Settings

- **Published** - Controls whether the page is visible on your site
- **Content Type** - Choose between Markdown or Page Builder
- **Placement** - Select where the page appears in navigation

### Markdown Content

When using markdown, you can:
- Format text with headers, lists, bold, italics etc.
- Add images and media
- Embed videos from YouTube, Vimeo and other platforms
- Include file attachments

The page builder provides drag-and-drop blocks for:

- **Headings** - H1-H6 text headers
- **Paragraphs** - Rich text content with formatting
- **Images** - Upload and embed images with alt text
- **Projects** - Display selected projects from your directory

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/page-builder-demo.png" alt="Page builder interface" />
</Frame>

## Managing Pages

From the pages list view you can:
- Edit existing pages
- Change page visibility
- Reorder pages within their placement section
- Delete unused pages
