Directify provides powerful import and export capabilities to help you manage your blog articles in bulk. You can easily import articles from a CSV file, including WordPress exports, and export your existing articles to CSV format.

## Importing Articles

To import articles into your directory:

1. Download the example CSV file to see the correct format
2. Prepare your CSV file with the following columns:

### Required Fields
- **title** - The article title (required, max 255 characters)
- **content** - The main content of your article

### Optional Fields
- **slug** - URL-friendly version of the title (max 255 characters, auto-generated if left blank)
- **published** - Whether the article should be published (true/false)
- **published_at** - Publication date and time in UTC format
- **thumbnail_url** - URL to the article's featured image
- **meta_title** - Custom SEO title
- **meta_description** - Custom SEO description

### WordPress Migration

You can easily migrate your existing WordPress blog by:

1. Exporting your WordPress articles to XML
2. Using our WordPress converter tool to transform the XML to CSV
3. Importing the resulting CSV file

### Import Settings

When importing articles, you can configure:

1. **Update Existing** - Choose whether to update existing articles
2. **Default Publishing** - Set whether imported articles should be published by default
3. **Preserve Dates** - Keep original publication dates from the import file

### Import Results

After the import completes, you'll see a notification in the top-right corner with:

- Number of successfully imported articles
- Number of failed imports
- Option to download detailed results

The results file includes all attempted imports with status and error messages. To review failures:

1. Download the results CSV
2. Scroll right to see the "Error" column
3. Review specific error messages for each failed row

Common error messages include:
- Invalid title length
- Missing required fields
- Malformed dates
- Invalid URLs

## Exporting Articles

You can export all your articles to CSV format for backup or bulk editing purposes. The exported file will contain all the fields listed above.

<Warning>
  Large blogs with many articles may take a few moments to export. The system will notify you once your export is ready for download.
