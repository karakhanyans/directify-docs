Directify provides powerful import and export capabilities to help you manage your listings in bulk. You can easily import listings from a CSV file and export your existing listings to CSV format.

## Importing Categories

To import categories into your directory:

1. Download the example CSV file to see the correct format
2. Prepare your CSV file with the following columns:

### Required Fields
- **title** - The category name (required, max 255 characters)

### Optional Fields
- **slug** - URL-friendly version of the title (max 255 characters, auto-generated if left blank)
- **content** - Detailed content/description for the category

### Import Settings

When importing categories, you can configure:

1. **Update Existing** - Choose whether to update existing categories
2. **Default Publishing** - Set whether imported categories should be published by default

<Note>
  Make sure your CSV file uses UTF-8 encoding for proper handling of special characters.
</Note>

### Import Results

After the import completes, you'll see a notification in the top-right corner with:

- Number of successfully imported articles
- Number of failed imports
- Option to download detailed results

The results file includes all attempted imports with status and error messages. To review failures:

1. Download the results CSV
2. Scroll right to see the "Error" column
3. Review specific error messages for each failed row

Common error messages include:
- Invalid title length
- Missing required fields
- Malformed dates
- Invalid URLs

<Tip>
  Use the error messages to correct issues in your import file, then retry importing the failed rows.
</Tip>

## Exporting Categories

You can export all your categories to CSV format for backup or bulk editing purposes. The exported file will contain all the fields listed above.

<Warning>
  Large directories with many categories may take a few moments to export. The system will notify you once your export is ready for download.
