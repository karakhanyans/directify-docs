Categories help organize your listings and make them easier to discover. Here's a breakdown of all the available fields when creating or editing a category:

### Required Fields

- **Title** (Required) - The name of your category that will be displayed throughout the directory

### Organization

- **Parent Category** - Make this a sub-category by selecting a parent category
- **Icon** - Choose an icon to visually represent this category
  - Select from hundreds of built-in icons
  - Icons appear in the sidebar and category cards

### Content

- **Content** (Optional) - Add rich markdown content to describe the category
  - Write formatted text with markdown
  - Add images and media
  - Embed videos from YouTube/Vimeo using:
    ```md
    ::: @iframe https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID :::
    ```

### Visibility Settings

- **Show on Sidebar** - Control category visibility in the navigation sidebar
  - When disabled, the category won't appear in the sidebar menu
  - Listings in hidden categories remain accessible through search and direct links

- **Active** - Toggle the overall visibility of the category
  - Inactive categories are completely hidden from the directory
  - Use this to temporarily hide categories without deleting them

## Best Practices

1. Use clear, descriptive category names
2. Create a logical hierarchy with parent/sub categories
3. Add icons to make categories visually distinct
4. Use content area to explain category purpose
5. Keep your category structure simple and intuitive

<Note>
  While you can create unlimited categories, we recommend keeping the structure simple to help visitors easily find what they're looking for.
